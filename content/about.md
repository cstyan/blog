My name is Callum. I work as a software developer in distributed systems and observability, currently at [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/) where I contribute to [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) and [Cortex](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/). I also organize the [Vancouver Go](https://www.meetup.com/golangvan/) meetup. This site is a collection of posts, mostly software related, written to have some sort of record of my progress and knowledge.
